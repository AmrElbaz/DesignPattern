Behavioral design patterns are concerned with
the interaction and responsibility of objects.

interaction between the objects should be in such a way that they can easily talk to each other and still should be loosely coupled.

Strategy Pattern
    A Strategy Pattern says that "defines a family of functionality, encapsulate each one, and make them interchangeable".
    The Strategy Pattern is also known as Policy.

Observer pattern (RX)
    is used when there is one-to-many relationship between objects such as if one object is modified,
    its dependent objects are to be notified automatically

Template method design pattern
    is to define an algorithm as skeleton of operations and leave the details to be implemented by the child classes.
